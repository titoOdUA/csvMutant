 # csv_transformator  
  It's a simple project. The sole reason for it - is to learn a bit of Rust.  
 ## What can it do?  
  It can process CSV files and change the content, the separator, and the encoding.  
  It would probably be some kind of CLI application with a bit of useful (for me) commands.  
 ## Will it work on windows?  
  Yes, it will.  
 ## What do I want to try in this project?  
- clap  
- csv processing  
- make myself familiar with some standard Rust structs and libraries, inner loops, code organization
